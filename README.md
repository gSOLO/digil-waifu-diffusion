# Digil Diffusion

*Digil Diffusion* is an amalgamation of various open source projects that contribute to the use of and extention to the utility of Stable Diffusion, **an AI driven machine learning model used to generate digital images from natural language descriptions**.


## Waifu Diffusion

Waifu Diffusion is the name for the project of finetuning Stable Diffusion on images and captions downloaded through Danbooru.

## Web UI, GFPGAN, Real-ESRGAN, ESRGAN, and More

Has an implemetation of the [AUTOMATIC1111 Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), to drive a number of settings and additional features (e.x. [GFPGAN](https://github.com/gSOLO/GFPGAN) for face fixing, and [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/gSOLO/Real-ESRGAN) for upscaling).

## Web UI Features

[Detailed feature showcase with images](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Features):
- Original txt2img and img2img modes
- One click install and run script (but you still must install python and git)
- Outpainting
- Inpainting
- Prompt Matrix
- Stable Diffusion Upscale
- Attention, specify parts of text that the model should pay more attention to
    - a man in a ((tuxedo)) - will pay more attention to tuxedo
    - a man in a (tuxedo:1.21) - alternative syntax
    - select text and press ctrl+up or ctrl+down to automatically adjust attention to selected text (code contributed by anonymous user)
- Loopback, run img2img processing multiple times
- X/Y plot, a way to draw a 2 dimensional plot of images with different parameters
- Textual Inversion
    - have as many embeddings as you want and use any names you like for them
    - use multiple embeddings with different numbers of vectors per token
    - works with half precision floating point numbers
- Extras tab with:
    - GFPGAN, neural network that fixes faces
    - CodeFormer, face restoration tool as an alternative to GFPGAN
    - RealESRGAN, neural network upscaler
    - ESRGAN, neural network upscaler with a lot of third party models
    - SwinIR, neural network upscaler
    - LDSR, Latent diffusion super resolution upscaling
- Resizing aspect ratio options
- Sampling method selection
- Interrupt processing at any time
- 4GB video card support (also reports of 2GB working)
- Correct seeds for batches
- Prompt length validation
     - get length of prompt in tokens as you type
     - get a warning after generation if some text was truncated
- Generation parameters
     - parameters you used to generate images are saved with that image
     - in PNG chunks for PNG, in EXIF for JPEG
     - can drag the image to PNG info tab to restore generation parameters and automatically copy them into UI
     - can be disabled in settings
- Settings page
- Running arbitrary python code from UI (must run with --allow-code to enable)
- Mouseover hints for most UI elements
- Possible to change defaults/mix/max/step values for UI elements via text config
- Random artist button
- Tiling support, a checkbox to create images that can be tiled like textures
- Progress bar and live image generation preview
- Negative prompt, an extra text field that allows you to list what you don't want to see in generated image
- Styles, a way to save part of prompt and easily apply them via dropdown later
- Variations, a way to generate same image but with tiny differences
- Seed resizing, a way to generate same image but at slightly different resolution
- CLIP interrogator, a button that tries to guess prompt from an image
- Prompt Editing, a way to change prompt mid-generation, say to start making a watermelon and switch to anime girl midway
- Batch Processing, process a group of files using img2img
- Img2img Alternative
- Highres Fix, a convenience option to produce high resolution pictures in one click without usual distortions
- Reloading checkpoints on the fly
- Checkpoint Merger, a tab that allows you to merge two checkpoints into one
- [Custom scripts](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Custom-Scripts) with many extensions from community
- [Composable-Diffusion](https://energy-based-model.github.io/Compositional-Visual-Generation-with-Composable-Diffusion-Models/), a way to use multiple prompts at once
     - separate prompts using uppercase `AND`
     - also supports weights for prompts: `a cat :1.2 AND a dog AND a penguin :2.2`
- No token limit for prompts (original stable diffusion lets you use up to 75 tokens)
- DeepDanbooru integration, creates danbooru style tags for anime prompts (add --deepdanbooru to commandline args)

## Stable Diffusion

*Stable Diffusion was made possible thanks to a collaboration with [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and [Runway](https://runwayml.com/) and builds upon previous work.*


Stable Diffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model.
Thanks to a generous compute donation from [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and support from [LAION](https://laion.ai/), they were able to train a Latent Diffusion Model on 512x512 images from a subset of the [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) database. 
Similar to Google's [Imagen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487), this model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts.
With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, the model is relatively lightweight and runs on a GPU with at least 10GB VRAM.

## Comments 

- The codebase for the diffusion models builds heavily on [OpenAI's ADM codebase](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion)
and [https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch). 

- The implementation of the transformer encoder is from [x-transformers](https://github.com/lucidrains/x-transformers) by [lucidrains](https://github.com/lucidrains?tab=repositories).
